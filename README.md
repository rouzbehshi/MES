# MES
This repository is a part of the "LOW-CARBON TECHNOLOGIES" course project in Politecnico di Milano. The aim of this project is to find the optimal operating strategy of a Multi-energy system (MES) that minimizes the total operating costs.
The MES is composed of the following components:
1. 1 CHP consist of an Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) fueled with biomass, producing heat and electricity.
2. 1 heat pump, producing heat by consuming using electricity.
3. 2 boilers, producing heat by consuming Natural gas (NG).
4. A thermal storage system.
5. An electric storage system (battery).
